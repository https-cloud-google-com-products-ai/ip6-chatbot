Kind regards, 
Then I search the perfect room for this event with a good atmosphere.
Yes of course! 
The first room is a big event room with a lot of technical services (projector, speakers). This room is made for people and costs. It's a very big room, so I think it's not the perfect place for your event. 
The second one is the one I told you about a few minutes ago. 
And the last one is an historic room, made with love to the detail. Everything is in the style of. This room is made for people and costs
Is the atmosphere by the second room good? Then we will a room where the people feel well and can form small groups.
Thank you very much.
Yes, what for an event are your planning?
How many persons will be there?
How much must it cost?
And shall the room be classic or modern?
I will present to you two rooms and then you can choose which one you like
Do you agree?
Okay
First, we have a cheaper room
Which is modern but is in the floor
It costs  swiss francs
It has a bar and the tables are for four persons and each table has a light
It has a terrace
So the room inside is just for  persons but in the terrace it has place for other  persons
The other one is a bit classic
The original decoration is from 
But it is in the first stock
So, you don't have to use the lift
The tables are for - persons
So, you can make bigger groups
The first one the modern one costs just  swiss francs
And the second one the classic one costs  swiss francs
I have another one but I think it is not the room you want
Because you can't make groups there
And it is too big
It is for persons
And it don't have tables
For groups
Okay I well arrange it for you
Yes
Yes it has
And another special thing is that you can see the city view
I'm afraid not!
When does the event take place?
Which day?
Dear Madam, thank you for contacting us. Absolutely, please ask any questions you have.
We have three possible event rooms on offer which are suitable. a stage with fixed seats a bar with tables and a lounge terrace. a big hall with tables and chairs. All big enough for your required size.
All rooms are within your budget. I think the stage (room) isn't ideal because the seats cannot be moved. Room offers seats for people inside and you could also use the outdoor terrace lounge. Room Alpha is indoors only but tables & chairs can be moved during the event.
Does it matter to you on which floor the room is?
It's  francs. The decoration is in the s style, very impressive - a good choice! I'm happy to place a reservation for you!
If you send me your company details the booking is done.

Yes, you have very good light in this room! That is the special in this room
The room costs more than the others is that ok for you?
